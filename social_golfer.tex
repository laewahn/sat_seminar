\section{Abstract}

\section{Introduction}

- [ ] There is a lot of research in SAT solvers
- [ ] Interest in solving other problems (combinatorial, constraints)
      using SAT
- [ ] Disadvantages of transforming non-SAT problems into SAT problems
    - [ ] Results in huge SAT problems with possibly millions of clauses
    - [ ] Removes structure of original problem
    - [ ] Nature of problem can influence best encoding for the problem
        - [ ] Automatic encoding can result in bad performance during
              solving

\section{Encoding of the social golfer problem}

- [ ] Description
    - [ ] Specific
    - [ ] Generalized
- [ ] Encoding
    - [ ] Defining the variables
    - [ ] Building constraints
        - [ ] "External constraints"
        - [ ] "Internal constraints"
            - [ ] Ladder Matrix

\section{Symmetry breaking}

- [ ] What are (the) symmetries
- [ ] How to break symmetries (different methods and their trade-offs)
    - [ ] Remodeling
    - [ ] Adding constraints to the model (statically)
    - [ ] Adding constraints during search (dynamically)
- [ ] Breaking symmetries for the social golfer

\section{Conclusion}

- [ ] Removing symmetries can speed up the SAT solving by reducing the
      solution space
- [ ] Removing symmetries adds extra costs to the modelling process
    - [ ] Trade-off: costs for eliminating symmetries vs. cost for
          longer run of solver
    - [ ] Does not always pay off (as results in the paper show)
- [ ] Social golfer encoding made a trade-off between intuitive model
      and a model suited to avoid symmetries
