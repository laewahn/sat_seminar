\section{Introduction}

- [ ] There is a lot of research in SAT solvers

A lot of effort is put into developing faster and better SAT solvers every year. With the solvers becoming more efficient, it becomes more attractive to use SAT solving even for problems that do not occur naturally encoded in SAT, such as combinatorial problems or constraint problems. Transferring non-SAT problems into SAT-problems can yield several inefficiences. A constraint problem that, stated in its original form, consists of only few constraints can grow into millions of clauses when converted into SAT. Also, converting a problem into SAT , depending on the encoding that was chosen, might result in formulas that are not as intuitively and easy to understand as the original problem and therefore it might be hard to extend the problem to include further constraints and maintain it on the long run.

While a lot of research is done on optimising SAT solvers,

- [ ] Interest in solving other problems (combinatorial, constraints)
      using SAT
- [ ] Disadvantages of transforming non-SAT problems into SAT problems
    - [ ] Results in huge SAT problems with possibly millions of clauses
    - [ ] Removes structure of original problem
    - [ ] Nature of problem can influence best encoding for the problem
        - [ ] Automatic encoding can result in bad performance during
              solving

\section{Encoding of the social golfer problem}

- [ ] Description
    - [ ] Specific
    - [ ] Generalized
- [ ] Encoding
    - [ ] Defining the variables
    - [ ] Building constraints
        - [ ] "External constraints"
        - [ ] "Internal constraints"
            - [ ] Ladder Matrix

\section{Symmetry breaking}

- [ ] What are (the) symmetries
- [ ] How to break symmetries (different methods and their trade-offs)
    - [ ] Remodeling
    - [ ] Adding constraints to the model (statically)
    - [ ] Adding constraints during search (dynamically)
- [ ] Breaking symmetries for the social golfer

\section{Conclusion}

- [ ] Removing symmetries can speed up the SAT solving by reducing the
      solution space
- [ ] Removing symmetries adds extra costs to the modelling process
    - [ ] Trade-off: costs for eliminating symmetries vs. cost for
          longer run of solver
    - [ ] Does not always pay off (as results in the paper show)
- [ ] Social golfer encoding made a trade-off between intuitive model
      and a model suited to avoid symmetries
